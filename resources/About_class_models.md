Classification is a branch of Machine Learning. Using classification, models can be taught how to group data into different categories. These models can then be used to predict which categories new data falls into. In the case of this App, the models were trained using a large dataset (see the 'Background information' page). These models are then used to predict which category (Pro, Anti, Neutral or News) your tweet falls into. 

There are many models that can be used for classification, in this App three were selected:

- Linear SVC Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Voting Classifier
